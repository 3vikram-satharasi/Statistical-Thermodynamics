This project was an Assignment to be solved for the course during my undergrad.
This involved using partition funnctions to calculate the Equillibrium constants for various temperature and then finding the equillibrium concentration of air at temperatures from 2500K to 5000K
This also involved solving stiff algebriac equations for the solutions of molefractions of all eqautions. after the equillibrium concentration of air at all temperature is already know we then proceed to calculate te adiabatic constant for the air for these temperature ranges.
